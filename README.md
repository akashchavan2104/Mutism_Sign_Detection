# Mutism Sign Language Detection & Assistance using Computer Vision

* This project helps us to understand the sign language of mutism ( people who naturally lost their speech ).
* We used OpenCV & cvzone libraries for image processing & hand detection. 
* We used the Google Teachable platform to train our model. The self created training data is available in drive.
* Tensorflow Keras model working at the backend to classify the gesture in a real-time capture window. 
* The predicted message will be displayed on the top of the same capture window.

> Main : To create training data of basic gestures/actions of mutism.

> Test : To demonstrate outcome in real-time capture window.
